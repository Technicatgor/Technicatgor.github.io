## Convert VHDX To VMDK

### Virtual Box to convert 
[Download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

Open Command Prompt as admin and run this command:
```
cd C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
```
Next run the following command with the correct paths to the vhdx file and where you want to store the copy
```
.\VBoxManage.exe clonehd --format vmdk C:\temp\My-VM.vhdx ะก:\temp\My-VM.vmdk
```

### QEMU-IMG
- Windows
[Download](https://cloudbase.it/qemu-img-windows/)

- Linux
```
sudo apt-get install qemu-utils
```

Open a Command Prompt as Admin to the location of the program and you can run this command to view the disk info:
```
qemu-img.exe info c:\temp\My-VM.vhd
```

Here is an example of how to convert a vhdx file:
```
qemu-img.exe convert -p c:\temp\My-VM.vhdx -O vmdk c:\temp\My-VM.vmdk
```

## Converting VMDK to the ESXi format
Upload the converted VMDK file to the datastore of ESXi

Enable SSH access on your ESXi host (Manage > Services > TSM-SSH)
![ssh-enabled](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SSH-access-is-enabled-on-an-ESXi-host.png)

Go to the directory where the VMDK was uploaded
`cd /vmfs/volumes/SSD2/converted`

Use vmkfstools to convert VMDK to ESXi format.
```
vmkfstools -i My-VM.vmdk My-VMthin.vmdk -d thin
```

As you can see on the directory, the conversion  with vmkfstools has completed successfully and two new files have been created:

My-VMthin-flat.vmdk

My-VMthin.vmdk
