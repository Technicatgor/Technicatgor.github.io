## What is CrewAI

- CrewAI is an open-source framework for orchestrating and collaborating with multiple AI agents.
- It allows you to create different AI agents, each with its own role and capabilities.
- These agents can then work together to achieve complex tasks, similar to how a crew works on a ship.
- This framework is often used for research and development in multi-agent AI systems.
- You can find more information about CrewAI the framework on its GitHub page: [https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI)

## Key features

**1. Role-Based Agent Design:** This allows you to define specific roles, goals, and tools for each individual AI agent. Think of them as crew members with specialized skills contributing to a common goal.

**2. Autonomous Inter-Agent Delegation:** Agents can communicate, share information, and autonomously delegate tasks among themselves. This streamlines problem-solving and allows for dynamic task distribution.

**3. Flexible Task Management:** You can design tasks with custom tools and dynamically assign them to specific agents based on their expertise. This ensures the right tool for the job gets used.

**4. Processes-Driven:** Currently, CrewAI supports sequential and hierarchical workflows, like following a set of instructions or a decision tree. More complex processes like consensual and autonomous are under development.

**5. Local Model Integration:** You can integrate pre-trained AI models like Ollama into CrewAI for specific tasks or data privacy needs.

**6. Open-Source:** CrewAI is built with an open-source approach, allowing for community contributions and customization.

### **Advantages of CrewAI:**

- **Flexibility:** Offers a balance between the ease of building conversational agents and the structure of process-driven approaches.
- **Adaptability:** Dynamic processes allow for seamless integration into development and production workflows.
- **Collaboration:** Enables teamwork among AI agents, enhancing efficiency and tackling complex challenges.

| **Agent Roles**              | Explicitly defined with specific capabilities           | Dynamically assigned based on task requirements             |
| **Task Management**          | Manually designed and assigned                          | Agents negotiate and select tasks themselves                |
| **Control & Predictability** | High, suitable for complex workflows                    | Lower, more adaptable                                       |
| **Learning & Adaptation**    | Less emphasis on on-the-fly learning                    | Agents can learn and adapt based on interactions            |
| **Ease of Use**              | Requires more upfront planning                          | Easier to start with, but may be complex for specific tasks |

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```shell
pip install crewai
```

The example below also uses DuckDuckGo's Search. You can install it with `pip` too:

```shell
pip install duckduckgo-search
```

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# You can choose to use a local model through Ollama for example. See ./docs/how-to/llm-connections.md for more information.
# from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
# ollama_llm = Ollama(model="openhermes")

# Install duckduckgo-search for this example:
# !pip install -U duckduckgo-search

from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()

# Define your agents with roles and goals
researcher = Agent(
  role='Senior Research Analyst',
  goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and data science',
  backstory="""You work at a leading tech think tank.
  Your expertise lies in identifying emerging trends.
  You have a knack for dissecting complex data and presenting actionable insights.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=False,
  tools=[search_tool]
  # You can pass an optional llm attribute specifying what mode you wanna use.
  # It can be a local model through Ollama / LM Studio or a remote
  # model like OpenAI, Mistral, Antrophic or others (https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/)
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  # from langchain_community.llms import Ollama
  # llm=ollama_llm # was defined above in the file
  #
  # from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
  # llm=ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5", temperature=0.7)
)
writer = Agent(
  role='Tech Content Strategist',
  goal='Craft compelling content on tech advancements',
  backstory="""You are a renowned Content Strategist, known for your insightful and engaging articles.
  You transform complex concepts into compelling narratives.""",
  verbose=True,
  allow_delegation=True,
  # (optional) llm=ollama_llm
)

# Create tasks for your agents
task1 = Task(
  description="""Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the latest advancements in AI in 2024.
  Identify key trends, breakthrough technologies, and potential industry impacts.
  Your final answer MUST be a full analysis report""",
  agent=researcher
)

task2 = Task(
  description="""Using the insights provided, develop an engaging blog
  post that highlights the most significant AI advancements.
  Your post should be informative yet accessible, catering to a tech-savvy audience.
  Make it sound cool, avoid complex words so it doesn't sound like AI.
  Your final answer MUST be the full blog post of at least 4 paragraphs.""",
  agent=writer
)

# Instantiate your crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
  agents=[researcher, writer],
  tasks=[task1, task2],
  verbose=2, # You can set it to 1 or 2 to different logging levels
)

# Get your crew to work!
result = crew.kickoff()

print("######################")
print(result)
```
