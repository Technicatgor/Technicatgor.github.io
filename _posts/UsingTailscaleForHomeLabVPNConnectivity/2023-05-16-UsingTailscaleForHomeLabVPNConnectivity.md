## What is Tailscale?
Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.

I am using Tailscale for VPN on my all devices. My pfsense is installed Tailscale package that is set up as an exit node and advertises my home network.
